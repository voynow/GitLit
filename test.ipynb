       "# Deep Dive into the CallingGPT Project\n",
       "\n",
       "CallingGPT is an innovative project that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT models to create a self-hosted ChatGPT-Plugins-like platform. This article will take a deep dive into the technical aspects of the project, explaining its architecture, design decisions, and key functionalities.\n",
       "\n",
       "## System Architecture\n",
       "\n",
       "The CallingGPT project is primarily built using Python, a popular high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. The project utilizes OpenAI's GPT models, which provide a function calling feature. This allows developers to easily create tools similar to ChatGPT-Plugins.\n",
       "\n",
       "The project is organized into modules and functions, which are encapsulated in a `Namespace` class. This class acts as a virtual container for functions, and is generated automatically by CallingGPT with user-provided modules.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Design Decisions\n",
       "\n",
       "The decision to use OpenAI's GPT models was driven by their advanced capabilities and versatility. These models provide a function calling feature, which allows developers to create tools that can interact with users in a conversational manner.\n",
       "\n",
       "Python was chosen as the programming language for this project due to its simplicity and wide range of libraries. Python's extensive support for AI and machine learning libraries, such as OpenAI, makes it an ideal choice for this project.\n",
       "\n",
       "The project's structure and organization were designed to be modular and scalable. The use of modules and functions allows for easy expansion and modification of the project.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Technical Details\n",
       "\n",
       "### Deep Dive into the Code\n",
       "\n",
       "The `main.py` file is the entry point of the project. It reads the OpenAI API key from `config.yaml`, imports the user-provided modules, and starts the CLI loop. If no modules are imported, the program runs in normal chat mode.\n",
       "\n",
       "The `Namespace` class, located in `src/CallingGPT/entities/namespace.py`, is a key component of the project. It acts as a virtual container for functions, which are retrieved from the user-provided modules. The `Namespace` class also provides methods to call a function by name, add a function, and add modules.\n",
       "\n",
       "The `Session` class, located in `src/CallingGPT/session/session.py`, manages the context for the user. It initializes a `Namespace` with the user-provided modules and manages the messages between the user and the assistant. The `Session` class also provides a method to ask a question, which automatically manages the context and calls the appropriate function if necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Function Parsing with Google Style Docstrings\n",
       "\n",
       "CallingGPT uses Google Style docstrings for function parsing. Each function must have a docstring in the Google Style, which includes a description, arguments, and returns sections. The docstring is used to generate a data schema for the function, which is stored in the `Namespace` class.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Managing Context with the Session Class\n",
       "\n",
       "The `Session` class plays a crucial role in managing the context for the user. It initializes a `Namespace` with the user-provided modules and manages the messages between the user and the assistant. The `Session` class also provides a method to ask a question, which automatically manages the context and calls the appropriate function if necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "The CallingGPT project is a powerful tool that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models to create a self-hosted ChatGPT-Plugins-like platform. Its modular design and use of Python make it a flexible and scalable solution for developers. The project's use of Google Style docstrings for function parsing and the `Session` class for context management are innovative features that enhance its functionality.\n",
       "\n",
       "Potential improvements for the project could include adding more modules and functions, improving the function parsing process, and enhancing the context management capabilities of the `Session` class. With its unique features and capabilities, the CallingGPT project is a significant contribution to the field of software engineering."
