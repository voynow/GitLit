       "# CallingGPT: A Deep Dive into OpenAI's Function Calling Feature\n",
       "\n",
       "## I. Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "CallingGPT is an open-source project that demonstrates the function calling feature of OpenAI's GPT models. The project serves as a proof-of-concept, showcasing how developers can create tools similar to `ChatGPT-Plugins` using this feature. The target audience for this project is developers who are interested in learning about and utilizing the function calling feature of GPT models.\n",
       "\n",
       "## II. Understanding the Project\n",
       "\n",
       "The core functionality of CallingGPT revolves around the function calling feature provided by OpenAI's GPT models. The project defines a `Plugin` as a `Namespace` that contains a series of functions. During a conversation, the functions in the `Namespace` are called by the API and the result is returned to the user.\n",
       "\n",
       "The concept of a `Namespace` is central to the project. A `Namespace` is a virtual container for functions, generated automatically by CallingGPT with user-provided modules. The `Namespace` manages the functions and their schemas, allowing for function calls and dynamic function addition.\n",
       "\n",
       "## III. System Architecture\n",
       "\n",
       "The project is organized into several modules, each serving a distinct purpose. The `main.py` script is the entry point of the application, responsible for reading the API key from the configuration file, importing the modules, and starting the command-line interface loop.\n",
       "\n",
       "The `Namespace` class, located in the `entities` module, is responsible for managing the functions. It retrieves the functions from the provided modules, generates their schemas, and allows for function calls and dynamic function addition.\n",
       "\n",
       "The `Session` class, located in the `session` module, manages the conversation with the GPT model. It maintains the list of messages and allows for asking questions and calling functions.\n",
       "\n",
       "## IV. Code Analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "The project makes extensive use of Python's built-in modules, such as `os`, `sys`, `logging`, `yaml`, `shutil`, `importlib`, and `inspect`, as well as third-party libraries like `openai`.\n",
       "\n",
       "The project uses Google Style docstrings for function parsing. Each function in the project is documented with a docstring that includes a description, the arguments, and the return value. This information is used to generate the function schema, which is required for the function calling feature of the GPT models.\n",
       "\n",
       "## V. Usage and Examples\n",
       "\n",
       "To use the project, first clone the repository and install the dependencies. Then, run the `main.py` script to generate the `config.yaml` file. Edit this file to set your API key and other settings. Finally, run the `main.py` script again and pass your modules as arguments.\n",
       "\n",
       "The project includes several example modules, such as `greet.py` and `draw.py`. The `greet.py` module provides a `greet` function that is called when the user asks GPT to greet someone. The `draw.py` module provides a `dalle_draw` function that uses the DALL·E model when the user asks GPT to draw something.\n",
       "\n",
       "## VI. Extending the Project\n",

       "# CallingGPT: A Deep Dive into OpenAI's Function Calling Feature\n",
       "\n",
       "## I. Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "CallingGPT is an innovative open-source project that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to create a self-hosted ChatGPT-Plugins-like platform. This project is a proof-of-concept of the function calling feature provided by OpenAI's GPT models. The target audience for this project is developers who are interested in exploring the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models and their function calling feature.\n",
       "\n",
       "## II. Understanding the Project\n",
       "\n",
       "The core functionality of CallingGPT revolves around the function calling feature of OpenAI's GPT models. This feature allows developers to define a `Plugin` as a `Namespace` containing a series of functions. During a conversation, these functions can be called by the API and return the result to the user.\n",
       "\n",
       "A `Namespace` in this context is a virtual container for functions, generated automatically by CallingGPT with user-provided modules. This concept is crucial to the project as it allows for the organization and management of functions that can be called by the API.\n",
       "\n",
       "## III. System Architecture\n",
       "\n",
       "The project is structured in a modular fashion, with each module playing a specific role. The main modules include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- `main.py`: This is the entry point of the project. It is responsible for reading the OpenAI API key from the `config.yaml` file, importing the user-provided modules, and initiating the command-line interface loop.\n",
       "- `session.py`: This module manages the conversation session with the GPT model. It keeps track of the messages and handles the function calling process.\n",
       "- `namespace.py`: This module defines the `Namespace` class, which is responsible for managing the functions that can be called by the API.\n",
       "\n",
       "## IV. Code Analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "The project heavily relies on Python's built-in modules and third-party libraries. For instance, the `importlib` module is used to dynamically import user-provided modules, and the `openai` library is used to interact with the OpenAI API.\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the unique aspects of this project is its use of Google Style docstrings for function parsing. Each function in the user-provided modules must have a docstring in the Google Style format. This docstring is then parsed to extract the function's description, arguments, and return value, which are used to generate the function's schema.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's an example of a function with a Google Style docstring:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def greet(user: str) -> str:\n",
       "    \"\"\"Return a greeting to `user`.\n",
       "    \n",
       "    Args:\n",
       "        user: the name to greet\n",
       "    \"\"\"\n",
       "    return \"Hello, {}!\".format(user)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "## V. Usage and Examples\n",
       "\n",
       "To use CallingGPT, you first need to clone the repository and install the dependencies:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "git clone https://github.com/RockChinQ/CallingGPT\n",
       "cd CallingGPT\n",
       "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, you can run the `main.py` script to generate the `config.yaml` file:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "python main.py\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "After setting your OpenAI API key and other settings in the `config.yaml` file, you can run the `main.py` script again and pass your modules as arguments:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "python main.py <module0> <module1> ...\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, you can use the `greet.py` module to make the bot greet someone:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "python main.py example/greet.py\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "## VI. Extending the Project\n",
       "\n",
       "Adding new functions to the project is straightforward. You just need to define your function in a Python module and make sure it has a Google Style docstring. Then, you can pass this module as an argument when running the `main.py` script.\n",
       "\n",
       "The project also supports dynamic module loading. This means you can load new modules during a conversation session by using the `load` command in the command-line interface.\n",
       "\n",
       "## VII. Testing\n",
       "\n",
       "The project includes several tests that you can run to verify its functionality. These tests are located in the `tests` directory and can be run using a Python test runner like `pytest`.\n",
       "\n",
       "To interpret the test results, you can refer to the test output and the test code itself. The test code includes comments that explain what each test is supposed to check.\n",
       "\n",
       "## VIII. Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "CallingGPT is a powerful tool that showcases the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models and their function calling feature. It provides a flexible and modular platform for developers to experiment with these features and create their own ChatGPT-Plugins-like tools.\n",
       "\n",
       "While the project is already quite feature-rich, there are still areas for potential improvements and extensions. For instance, support for more complex function schemas and better error handling could be added in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, CallingGPT is a valuable resource for developers interested in exploring the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models. It provides a solid foundation for building"
