# Deep Dive into git2doc: A Powerful Python Library for Converting Git Repositories into Documents

In this article, we will be exploring an open-source project called `git2doc`. This Python library is designed to convert git repositories into documents, making it easier to understand and work with large codebases. 

## What is git2doc?

`git2doc` is a Python library that simplifies the process of understanding large codebases by converting git repositories into documents. This allows developers to easily search, analyze, and understand the codebase. The library is particularly useful when working with large repositories, as it can be overwhelming to understand the structure and content of the code.

## How to Install git2doc

Installation of `git2doc` is straightforward and can be done using pip, the Python package installer. Here is the command to install `git2doc`:

```bash
pip install git2doc
```

## How to Use git2doc

`git2doc` provides several functionalities that can be used to fetch repositories, load repository data, and write data to Parquet files.

### Fetching Repositories

To fetch repositories, you can use the `get_repos_orchestrator` function. This function allows you to specify the number of repositories to fetch, the number of days to look back, and the language to filter by.

```python
from git2doc import get_repos_orchestrator

repos = get_repos_orchestrator(
    n_repos=10,
    last_n_days=30,
    language="Python"
)
```

### Loading Repository Data

To load repository data, you can use the `pull_code_from_repo` function. This function allows you to specify the repository URL and the branch to pull from.

```python
from git2doc import pull_code_from_repo

repo_data = pull_code_from_repo(
    repo="https://github.com/voynow/git2doc",
    branch="main"
)
```

### Writing Data to Parquet Files

To write data to Parquet files, you can use the `pipeline_fetch_and_load` function. This function allows you to specify the number of repositories to fetch, the number of days to look back, the language to filter by, and the batch size for writing.

```python
from git2doc import pipeline_fetch_and_load

pipeline_fetch_and_load(
    n_repos=1000,
    last_n_days=365,
    language="Python",
    write_batch_size=100,
    delete=True,
)
```
